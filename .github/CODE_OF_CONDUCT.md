# Code of Conduct

As contributors and maintainers of this project, we are committed to fostering an open and welcoming environment. We expect all participants to behave in a manner that contributes to a positive environment.

This all boils down to Wheaton's law:

> **Don't be a dick.**

If you expected something along the lines of the Contributor Covenant, I'm very sorry about that. Maybe next time.

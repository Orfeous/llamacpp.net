LlamaCpp.Net is a .NET wrapper for [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp), a C++ library for dealing with large language models.

In particular, we try to abstract away the complexity of dealing with the C++ code and provide a simple interface for using the library in .NET applications.
Nobody wants to deal with pointers and memory management in C#.

## Features

- **Fast** - LlamaCpp.Net is a thin wrapper around llama.cpp, which is written in C++ and is very fast
- **Idiomatic** - If there's a C# way of doing something, we do it the C# way.
- **Cross-platform** - LlamaCpp.Net is written in C# and can be used on Windows, Linux and macOS
- **Open-source** - LlamaCpp.Net is open-source and is licensed under the terms of the Apache 2.0 license
- **Batteries included** - LlamaCpp.Net comes with pre-built runtime binaries for different platforms and architectures

## Issue Reporting

If you encounter any issues or have a feature request, please open an issue on our issue tracker. When opening an issue, please provide as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce the issue or a clear description of the requested feature.

If, for whatever reason, you're not sure about opening an issue, you can contact us on Discord.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are welcome. Before submitting a pull request, please make sure that your changes are consistent with the coding style of the project. If you're unsure about the coding style, please refer to the existing code.

Before starting work, ask on Discord if the feature you're working on is something that would be accepted. There's also a possibility that someone else is already working on it, in which case you can coordinate with them, and you can help each other out. This will save you time and effort. If you're working on a bug fix, you can skip this step.

When submitting a pull request, please provide a clear description of the changes you have made. If your pull request is related to an issue, please reference the issue in the pull request description.
